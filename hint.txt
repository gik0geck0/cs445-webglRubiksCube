Here is a problem that might come up for some of you. You are selecting a menu item and your object moves (rotates) slightly, or just disappears. The reason for this might be `stray' mouse button up event that does not have a corresponding mouse button down event. It arises when you release the mouse button after selecting a menu entry. The solution is to detect and ignore these stray events. For example, define a global boolean MouseDown variable, that is initialized to false and set to false whenever mouse button goes up or true if it goes down. Then, when you get mouse button up event, just ignore it if MouseDown is false.
